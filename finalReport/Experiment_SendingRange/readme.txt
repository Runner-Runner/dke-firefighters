covering:
    simulation 20.000 ticks without fire
    count number of observations for each tile
    (if a tile is within agents seeing range)
    differ sending range for the patrol algorithm (4,8,12,16,32)
    covering seems to be best for sendingRange 8
    
results:
    simulation 30.000 ticks with fire
    measuring extinguished fires, forest health etc. indicates impact of sending range (4,8,16)
